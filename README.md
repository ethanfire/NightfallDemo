## Development Details
This game was a significant learning experience for me. I developed it completely independently, from coding to designing gameplay mechanics. The only aspect sourced externally were most audio and visual assets. Prior to this project, I had little to no experience with Unity or C#, but through perseverance and dedication, I overcame numerous challenges and gained valuable skills in game development and project management.

Developing this game has helped me learn so much about creating engaging gameplay experiences and managing complex projects. Moving forward, I'm excited to expand this project into the full Nightfall game. I'm currently focusing on refining the codebase to be more flexible and modular, allowing for scalability and easier expansion. Some of the planned enhancements include incorporating different types of enemies, implementing advanced AI with steering behaviors, and introducing new player abilities such as ground pounds and lightning magic alongside the existing fireballs.
